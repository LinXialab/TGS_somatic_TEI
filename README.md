# TGS_somatic_TEI
This pipeline is designed to identify and refine **somatic transposable element insertions (TEIs)** with high confidence. It integrates a series of tools and custom scripts to detect, correct, and annotate somatic structural variants (SVs), particularly large-scale insertions (INSs) and duplications (DUPs), focusing on transposable elements (TEs).
